# lance-ryan-professional-portfolio
My first professional portfolio.


I created this portfolio to start working towards a portfolio I can use to get a job as a professional programmer. I want to make sure I am able to showcase my abilities and what I have learned and prove that I have the know how to become a professional programmer.

I built this page from the gound up. This is a page that I plan on tweaking and making even better as the course goes on.

I learned a lot doing this site. At one point I just could not get the site to work no matter what I did. I ened up deleting the entire html and the css stylesheet and starting over. I was able to make it work after doing this. I ended learning that periods are very important. I had looked over the old save of the code so I could see exactly what it was that I had missed. As stated before, I had missed periods both with the pictures and the links to the page.
